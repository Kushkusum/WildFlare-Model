# ðŸŒ² Forest Fire Detection System

An IoT + AI based project to detect and confirm forest fires using sensors, an ESP32-CAM, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The system provides **early fire detection** to reduce response time and prevent large-scale damage.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Project Need
Forest fires cause severe ecological and human loss. Traditional detection methods (watchtowers, satellites, patrols) are **slow and error-prone**.  
This project addresses those challenges by combining IoT sensors with AI for:
- **Early detection** using temperature, humidity, infrared, and smoke sensors.  
- **High accuracy** fire confirmation via CNN.  
- **Energy efficiency** (ESP32-CAM activates only when sensors detect anomalies).  
- **Automated alerting** via buzzer upon fire confirmation.

## ðŸ–¥ File Usage Summary (Detailed)

- **/arduino/**
  - `CameraWebServer_copy.ino` â†’ Arduino sketch for ESP32-CAM.  
    - Upload via **Arduino IDE** after updating WiFi SSID, password, and Google App Script URL.  
  - `Base64.cpp` / `Base64.h` â†’ Utility files used by the ESP32-CAM sketch for encoding captured images before upload.  

- **/scripts/**
  - `ESP32_CAM.json` â†’ Google App Script.  
    - Copy contents into a new Google App Script project.  
    - Deploy as **Web App** to connect ESP32-CAM â†’ Google Drive.  

- **/notebooks/**
  - `CNN_FIRE_DETECT.ipynb` â†’ Colab notebook to train or test the CNN model.  
    - Use if you want to re-train the model or verify predictions.  
  - `Automated.ipynb` â†’ Optional notebook with automation logic (monitoring uploaded images and predicting fire presence automatically).  

- **/models/**
  - `CNN_FIRE_DETECT.h5` â†’ Pre-trained CNN model file.  
    - Load this in Colab for predictions.  
    - If this file is **not included** (due to GitHub size limits), you can re-train using `CNN_FIRE_DETECT.ipynb` and save it with:  
      ```python
      model.save('CNN_FIRE_DETECT.h5')
      ```  
    - Then place it in `/models/` or directly in your Google Drive.  

- **/data/**
  - `Data-Set.zip` â†’ Image dataset used for training/testing the CNN.  
    - Extract and use with the Colab notebook for training.  


ðŸ“Œ If You Donâ€™t Have the Model File
If `CNN_FIRE_DETECT.h5` is not present in the repo (due to GitHub file size limits):  
1. Open `CNN_FIRE_DETECT.ipynb` in Google Colab.  
2. Train the CNN on your dataset (`Data-Set.zip`).  
3. Save the trained model:  
   ```python
   model.save('CNN_FIRE_DETECT.h5')
